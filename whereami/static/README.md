Whereami?
========

![Whereami version 1](https://i.imgur.com/reGUXlP.png)

Idea based off of geoguessr. This was a weekend project I did just to come up with a first version. Feel free to pull, and add PRs on bugs you find (I know there are quite a few, which I'll get around to fiddling with on rainy days!).

Also, Please get your own google maps API when you start toying around with it.  Google tracks the amount of API hits ... so please get your own :)
